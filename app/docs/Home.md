Grid API Documentation
======================

Welcome to the **Grid API Documentation.**

Here you'll find the Lua documentation for the Grid engine. Classes, hooks, and
interfaces for game development have their references published here and are
organized by their listing in the engine and game directories.

If you'd like to hack on the Grid engine, you can always find the latest version
of the engine [here on GitHub.](https://github.com/andrewmcwatters/grid-sdk)

For other [Planimeter](/planimeter) projects, see our
[organization page.](https://github.com/Planimeter)
