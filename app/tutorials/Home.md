    **Hey! Listen!**
    [Planimeter](/planimeter)'s philosophy on documentation is
    that if you have to go to a third-party site to learn about a particular
    piece of software, _it isn't being properly documented by its authors._
  </p>
  <p>
    If we're not explaining how to use a part of our software, please
    [file an issue](https://github.com/andrewmcwatters/grid/issues) and we'll
    make sure to provide coverage.
