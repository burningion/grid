Getting Started
===============

Get Grid
--------

[Download](https://github.com/Planimeter/grid-sdk/releases) the latest
release of Grid from the GitHub repository and and extract it anywhere.

Running Grid
------------

On Windows, run `debug game.bat`. On OS X and Linux, run `debug game.sh` in your
terminal by typing <kbd>. "debug game.sh"</kbd> This will start Grid in
development mode, which enables real-time scripting, preventing you from having
to restart your game whenever you make changes.

Start a Game/Server
-------------------

In debug mode, the console will be opened on load for you automatically. From
here, type <kbd>region allorova</kbd> and hit <kbd>enter</kbd> to start a listen
server with *Allorova** as the starting region.

*Allorova* is the starting region in the game [Vertex Adventure](/vadventure),
which is bundled with Grid as sample code. In a future update, a test region
will be included.
